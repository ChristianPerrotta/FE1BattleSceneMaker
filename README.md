# FE1 Battle Scene Maker
This is my first ever complete program, written in python. It creates a png image of a battle scene from Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light (Japanese version) game, also known shortly as FE1, and is entirely customizable by the user. By setting parameters such as ally's and enemy's name, class, level, sprite, hit, attack etc., an image preview is generated in real time, which can be saved as a png file by clicking the 'Save' button. The result is an image like the following:

</p>
The program can be used by any content creator that needs a specific battle scene from FE1, without the need to recreate the battle in the actual game, taking a screenshot, and editing to adjust it to the creator's intent.

To run the application, it is necessary to have the two .py files and the two folders in the same directory. The main file to be run is fe1battlescenemaker.py.

The program may receive updates in the future, including English text option.
